# BAROCCO
This code accompanies the paper "Balancing Rational and Other-Regarding Preferences in Cooperative-Competitive Environments".

The code is divided into 4 folders, corresponding to the combinations of two envirionments (Harvest and Eldorado) and two frameworks (Q-learning and Actor-Criric).

## Harvest 

Harvest is a popular mixed environment for multi-agent reinforcement learning.

The code for the environment was provided by [https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games](https://github.com/eugenevinitsky/sequential_social_dilemma_games)

## Eldorado

Eldorado is an original mixed environment based on the NeuralMMO environment ([https://github.com/openai/neural-mmo](https://github.com/openai/neural-mmo)).

## Structure

```main.py``` is the main file, run it to train algorithms. Change algorithms, settings, and hyperparameters in ```configs.py```. Make figures from ```logs.py``` running ```figures.py```

The folder ```source``` contains all algorithm-related code. ```networks``` contains all neural networks. ```utils``` contains all optimization stuff required to train the networks. ```env``` contains all environment logic. ```agent``` contains high-level classes: ```learner.py``` and ```learner_social.py``` contain high-level logic to update networks, ```controller.py``` contains high-level logic for agent-environment interaction to collect rollouts, ```runner.py``` alternates between interaction with environment and network updates -- either sequentially (Actor-Critic) or in parallel (Q-learning).
